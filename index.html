<div id="tribute-info"><p>Azalea is a North Korean chimpanzee who is famous for her smoking habit. She is able to light her own cigarettes with a lighter, as well as by touching a cigarette to the end of another lit cigarette, though she reportedly does not inhale when she smokes.</p><p> Her smoking habit is encouraged by the zoo workers who look after her, as well as the general North Korean public, many of whom find her funny. </p>
<p>Smoking is widespread in North Korea - approximately 45% of adult men smoke regularly, and 30% of adult men die of tobacco related illnesses.</p>
<p>Korea Central Zoo has been criticised by animal rights groups who say it is cruel to  addict a chimpanzee to tobacco for human amusement and that smoking is as dangerous to Azalea as it is to humans.</p>
